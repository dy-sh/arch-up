# Minimal Desktop Indicator

An indicator/switcher for your virtual desktops/workspaces (also known as a "pager"), which shows the amount of virtual desktops available, and highlights the current one - all using simple unicode text characters.

As a former GNOME user, I was a huge fan of the Workspace Indicator extension found at <https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3952/workspace-indicator/>, so I decided to re-create it for Plasma to help me feel at home. I enjoy the minimalist style (hence my naming choice), and I'm hoping you do too!

### Features:
* Customisable left-click/right-click actions
* Switch desktops by scrolling widget
* Workspace wraparound
* Show desktops in a single row or follow Plasma setting
* Customisable indicator size

### To-Do:
* Support for multi-monitor setups

*If you find any bugs, or if there is a feature that you'd like to see, please don't hesitate to open an issue on the GitHub repo and I'll try to get to it as soon as I can!*
